`ecositer` leverages `soilDB` to access soil and vegetation data from NASIS. Currently, these functions require NASIS permissions, but future development will prioritize making NASIS data access publicly accessible. 

This tutorial will cover the following topics:
- creating static snapshots of NASIS data
- manipulating NASIS data into a useful format

```vegStaticNASIS()``` takes a snapshot of your NASIS selected set and saves it in a local SQLite database. This locally stored version can be referenced using its path at any time, regardless of changes to your selected set. You will likely find this to be an easy and reliable way of accessing data of interest. The functionality of creating static NASIS selected sets is borrowed from [soilDB](https://github.com/ncss-tech/soilDB). ```vegStaticNASIS()``` is a special case designed specifically for vegetation data. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ecositer::vegStaticNASIS(output_path = "C:/Users/Nathan.Roe/Documents/SEKI/CA792_veg.sqlite")
```
