`ecositer` is a collection of tools for the analysis, standardization,
and automation of vegetation analysis. These tools work with data from
the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), but the data
structure and format used is intended to be applicable to vegetation
analysis more broadly. To the extent possible, this package uses sources
of NRCS data that are publicly accessible, increasing the relevance to
non-agency users.
